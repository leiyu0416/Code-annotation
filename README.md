Before starting a Pytorch training project, we need to initialize some things.
Firstly, initialize the weights of the model.These values determine the importance of each input signal when transmitted to the next layer. During the training process, the model continuously adjusts its weights to better fit the data.
Secondly, initialize the bias of the model.During the training process, the model will continuously adjust the bias to better fit the data. Initializing bias can help the model converge faster. If initialization is not carried out, the initial value of the bias may be too large or too small, resulting in poor performance of the model in the early stages of training. By properly initializing the bias, the model can better fit the data in the early stages of training.
Finally, initialize the batch normalization.Initializing the batch normalization layer can help the model converge faster.

Basic steps for preparing optimization algorithms in PyTorch

1.Define the model and move it to the appropriate device (such as GPU).
2.Select a loss function to calculate the difference between the model output and the target.
3.Select an optimizer, such as torch. optim. SGD or torch. optim. Adam, and pass the model parameters to it.
4.Define a learning rate scheduler for dynamically adjusting the learning rate.
5.Loading dataset: When training the model, it is necessary to load the training and validation sets, and perform preprocessing, data augmentation, and other operations on the data.
6.Defining a training cycle: When training a model, it is necessary to define a training cycle.
